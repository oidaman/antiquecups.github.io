      <h1>The collection and the families</h1>
      <p>Antique cups are frequently collected and admired for their beautiful craftsmanship, colours and shapes but often the most interesting and historical aspects are entirely overlooked. These cups were often once owned by renowned and powerful families, with interesting stories and histories. I have built a cup collection that is not only interesting to look at but also fascinating to dwell into the history of these porcelain marvels. I have spent many decades compiling and researching these families, this website is a way to keep their legacies alive and show the world their once prized heirlooms.</p>

        <h1 id="crest"><img src="Resources/Wermacht_crest.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /> The Wermacht Family Cup</h1>
    
        <p><i>A tale of blood and violence</i></p>
        <p>A rather innocent looking cup, however the Wermacht family went through a great deal of pain due to this porcelain marvel. Acquired by Otto Wermacht in 1879 in Austria from a deceased friend, Otto’s wife took a quick liking to the cup and had it displayed by her bedside table. One night in 1880 her throat was slit in the night, the Austrian high council tried Otto for the murder of his wife, and he was hanged twelve days later. His son Wolfgang inherited the cup and passed it onto his wife as a proclamation of his love to her. </p>

        <p><i>A story of unbelievable luck and fortune</i></p>
        <p>A family of craftsmen and lumberjacks, living in a sort of commune in the forest, a simplistic sustainable lifestyle. Hence the ownership of such a rich object brings surprise. The cup is an object of mystery supposedly it was found tangled in the trunk of a felled oak, and family legend says that after this relic was unearthed the commune began to flourish, crops began growing in great yield and abundance, and children were being cured of sickness. The cup quickly became an object of worship. </p>

        <p><i>An artistic perspective</i></p>
        <p>An artistic syndicate the Francois were a well-known family in Paris for their eccentric behaviours and influence in fashion and art during the 18th and 19th century. The cup was the creation of the illegitimate-child of Anton Francois as a way to show the family that he was still very much gifted despite the lack of surname.</p>

        <p><i>A drunk tale</i></p>
        <p>From a small village south of Dublin during the Great Famine, a Scottish-Irish family of drunks acquired the cup after Oisin McKaw bet the owner of local tavern that he could finish two pints of bourbon in under a minute. For winning he would get the taverns most exquisite object, a cup gifted by a Japanese traveller, if he lost he would forfeit his ‘Sir’ title to the tavern owner. Oisin won the bet, however he paid for it with his life – two days later he was found dead in his bed, it was said the hangover had killed him.</p>

        <p><i>A story of escape</i></p> 
        <p> Caught in the chaos of the USSR a once royal and wealthy family had their lands and riches stripped by Stalin government due to their very open proclamation of faith. This cup was one of the few items smuggled into borders of Poland, due to having great significance to the family as it was part of Alexander II the Liberators wife’s royal collection. Interestingly this cup was found and purchased in a garage sale in a small village in Poland. </p>
